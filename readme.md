A  web scraping project with python - beautfulsoup4. If one is
looking to start contributing to open source, finding issues with the
tag <span>good first issue</span> is a great way to start the journey.
But it can be quite hard to find such issues manually going through
different repositories.<br />
So here you search a term, flask server recieves it, web scraper
searches for that in github, collects results for upto 5 pages, then
goes thorugh them to find issues labeled with 'good first issue'. Then
returns the data which is fetched using axios in client side. <br />
Performance wise, maybe using python wasn't really the best idea. I did
a web scraping project with c# once, compared to that, this felt quite
slower. But it's made primarily for project purposes, and I really
wanted to use python in it.
